# My Physics and Mathematics Learning Journal

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to educational articles, specially in Physics and Mathematics, that I've written. Each article offers unique and valuable insights.

My aim is to break down complex topics into clear, logical steps, exploring the "why" behind the concepts. All derivations are presented with a focus on fundamental principles and precision, utilizing LaTeX for clear mathematical notation.

I'm building this collection as a personal learning journal and as a public portfolio of my understanding.

## Articles and Derivations

### 1. Rigorous Derivation of Battery Terminal Voltage ($V = \text{emf} - ir$)

**Link:** [Rigorous derivation of the relationship between terminal voltage and EMF of a battery.md](Rigorous%20derivation%20of%20the%20relationship%20between%20terminal%20voltage%20and%20EMF%20of%20a%20battery.md)

**Summary:** This article meticulously derives the fundamental equation for a battery's terminal voltage, starting from the initial charge separation in an open circuit, defining EMF, analyzing transient and steady states in a closed circuit, and connecting these first principles to the classical $V = \text{emf} - ir$ expression. It delves into the energy conversions and the physical origin of internal resistance.

### 2. Rigorous Derivation of the Relationship Between Gibbs Free Energy and Cell Potential, Leading to the Nernst Equation

**Link:** [Rigorously Deriving the Relationship Between Gibbs Free Energy and Cell Potential, Leading to the Nernst Equation](Rigorously%20Deriving%20the%20Relationship%20Between%20Gibbs%20Free%20Energy%20and%20Cell%20Potential.md)

**Summary:** This article provides a rigorous derivation of the Nernst Equation, beginning with the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics to define Gibbs Free Energy ($\Delta G$) as the maximum non-PV work. It then connects this thermodynamic potential to electrical work in an electrochemical cell, establishing the fundamental relationship $\Delta G = -nFE_{cell}$. Finally, by incorporating the relationship between $\Delta G$, $\Delta G^\circ$, and the reaction quotient ($Q$), the Nernst Equation ($E_{cell} = E_{cell}^\circ - \frac{RT}{nF}\ln Q$) is derived, highlighting its significance in predicting cell potential under non-standard conditions.
