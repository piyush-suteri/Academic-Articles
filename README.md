# My Physics and Mathematics Learning Journal:
Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to in-depth educational articles and derivations in Physics and Mathematics. This collection serves as a public portfolio of my understanding and a personal learning journal.

My approach is to explore the "why" behind complex concepts, breaking them down into clear, logical steps from fundamental principles. All derivations are presented with a focus on rigor and precision, utilizing LaTeX for clear mathematical notation.

### 1. The Physics Behind a Battery: A First-Principles Derivation of Terminal Voltage ($V = \text{emf} - ir$)

**Summary:** This article meticulously derives the fundamental equation for a battery's terminal voltage. It begins with the physics of charge separation in an open circuit, rigorously defines EMF, and then analyzes the transient and steady states in a closed circuit. The derivation connects these first principles to the classical $V = \text{emf} - ir$ expression, while also exploring the physical origin of internal resistance and energy conversions.

### 2. From Thermodynamics to Electrochemistry: Rigorously Deriving the Nernst Equation

**Summary:** This article provides a rigorous derivation of the Nernst Equation, beginning with the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics to define Gibbs Free Energy ($\Delta G$) as the maximum non-PV work. It connects this thermodynamic potential to electrical work in an electrochemical cell, establishing the fundamental relationship $\Delta G = -nFE_{cell}$. The final derivation highlights the equation's significance in predicting cell potential under non-standard conditions.

### 3. (Coming Soon) Why is Electric Force Medium Dependent?

**Summary:** Unlike gravitational force, the electric force is dependent on the medium through which it is acting. However, it shares similarities with gravitational force. In this article, I will provide a detailed explanation of this phenomenon using a first-principles approach. The article will also include visual diagrams and illustrations generated using Python (NumPy + Matplotlib).
